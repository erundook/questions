This is a demo app I wrote for a job interview.
It is based on rails 3.1.1.rc2, and it makes use of haml, coffeescript, and some simple AJAX techs.
The code is also covered by a few simple rSpec unit tests (including models & controllers).

A working demo of this app can be found at http://questions.erundook.net/
